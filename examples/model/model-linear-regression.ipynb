    "The dashboard of six residual plots looks excellent, as we might expect for these data. True values and predicted values from the regression form a straight line with random scatter, i.e., as the actual values of the response variable go up, so do the predicted values from the model. The residuals (i.e., the differences between the values of the response variable data and the values predicted by the regression) show no pattern and are randomly scattered around a horizontal line. Any pattern would suggest that the model is better (or worse) at predicting some parts of the data compared to others. If a pattern were visible in the Residual vs Row order plot we might be concerned about auto-correlation. Again, the residuals are nicely scattered about a horizontal axis. Note that auto-correlation is a problem we are really only concerned about when we have time-series data. The Q-Q plot shows a nice straight and diagonal line, evidence that the residuals are normally distributed. This conclusion is confirmed by the histogram of the residuals and the density plot of the residuals (green) versus the theoretical density of a normally distributed variable (blue line)."

Second, each variable is statistically significant. For example, the p.value on the t-statistic for x1 is less than 0.05 therefore we reject the null hypothesis that x1 has a slope equal to zero when x2 and x3 are also in the model (i.e., ‘holding all other variables in the model constant’).\n",

The residuals (i.e., the differences between the actual data and the values predicted by the regression) show an even more distinct pattern as they are clearly not randomly scattered around a horizontal axis. The Residual vs Row order plot looks perfectly straight indicating that auto-correlation is not a concern. Finally, while for the ideal data in Example 2 the Q-Q plot showed a nice straight diagonal line, here dots clearly separate from the line at the right extreme. Evidence that the residuals are not normally distributed. This conclusions is confirmed by the histogram and density plots of the residuals that show a more spiked appearance than a normally distributed variable would."

    "The dashboard of six residual plots looks much better than for the linear model. The true values and predicted values from the regression (almost) form a straight line. Although at higher and lower actual and predicted values the line is perhaps still very slightly curved. The residuals are much closer to a random scatter around a horizontal line. The Residual vs Row order plot still looks perfectly straight indicating that auto-correlation is not a concern. Finally, the Q-Q plot shows a nice straight and diagonal line, just like we saw for the ideal data in Example 2. Evidence that the residuals are now normally distributed. This conclusion is confirmed by the histogram and density plot of the residuals."

    "Since the diagnostics now look much better, we can feel more confident about drawing inferences from this regression. The regression results are available in the Summary tab. Note that we get 7 coefficients for the variable clarity compared to only one for carat_ln. How come? If you look at the data description (Data > Manage) you will see that clarity is a categorical variables with levels that go from IF (worst clarity) to I1 (best clarity). Categorical variables must be converted to a set of dummy (or indicator) variables before we can apply numerical analysis tools like regression. Each dummy indicates if a particular diamond has a particular clarity level (=1) or not (=0). Interestingly, to capture all information in the 8-level clarity variable we only need 7 dummy variables. Note there is no dummy variable for the clarity level I1 because we don’t actually need it in the regression. When a diamond is not of clarity SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1 or IF we know that in our data it must be of clarity I1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The F-statistic suggests that the regression model as a whole explains a significant amount of variance in price_ln. The F-statistic is very large and has a very small p.value (< 0.001) so we can reject the null hypothesis that all regression coefficients are equal to zero. The amount of variance in price_ln explained by the model is equal to 96.6. It seems likely that prices of diamonds will be much easier to predict than demand for diamonds.\n",
    "\n",
    "The null and alternate hypothesis for the F-test can be formulated as follows: H0: All regression coefficients are equal to 0 Ha: At least one regression coefficient is not equal to zero\n",
    "\n",
    "The coefficients from the regression can be interpreted as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* For a 1% increase in carats we expect, on average, to see a 1.809% increase in the price of a diamond of, keeping all other variables in the model constant\n",
    "* Compared to a diamond of clarity I1 we expect, on average, to pay 100x(exp(.444)-1) = 55.89% more for a diamond of clarity SI2, keeping all other variables in the model constant\n",
    "* Compared to a diamond of clarity I1 we expect, on average, to pay 100x(exp(.591)-1) = 80.58% more for a diamond of clarity SI1, keeping all other variables in the model constant\n",
    "* Compared to a diamond of clarity I1 we expect, on average, to pay 100x(exp(1.080)-1) = 194.47% more for a diamond of clarity IF, keeping all other variables in the model constant\n",
    "\n",
    "The coefficients for each of the levels of clarity imply that an increase in clarity will increase the price of diamond. Why then did the scatter plot of clarity versus (log) price show price decreasing with clarity? The difference is that in a regression we can determine the effect of a change in one variable (e.g., clarity) keeping all other variables in the model constant (i.e., carat). Bigger, heavier, diamonds are more likely to have flaws compared to small diamonds so when we look at the scatter plot we are really seeing the effect of not only improving clarity on price but also the effect of carats which are negatively correlated with clarity. In a regression, we can compare the effects of different levels of clarity on (log) price for a diamond of the same size (i.e., keeping carat constant). Without (log) carat in the model the estimated effect of clarity would be incorrect due to omitted variable bias. In fact, from a regression of price_ln on clarity we would conclude that a diamond of the highest clarity in the data (IF) would cost 59.22% less compared to a diamond of the lowest clarity (I1). Clearly this is not a sensible conclusion.\n",
