    "In addition to the numerical output shown above we can also investigate the association between `pclass` and `survived` visually. The first chart has standard error bars for the proportion of `yes` entries for `survived` in the sample. Consistent with the summary results shown above there are clear differences in the survival rate across passenger classes. The `Dodge` chart shows the proportions of `yes` and `no` in `survived` side-by-side for each passenger class. While 1st class passengers had a higher proportion of `yes` than `no` the opposite seems to hold for the 3rd class passengers."

    "The p.value for the test of differences in the survival proportion for 1st versus 2nd class passengers is **< .001**. This is the probability of observing a sample **difference in proportions** that is as or more extreme than the sample **difference in proportions** from the data if the null hypothesis is true. In this case, it is the probability of observing a sample **difference in proportions** that is less than **-0.194** or greater than **0.194** if the true population **difference in proportions** is **0**.\n",

    "The 95% confidence interval is **0.112** to **0.277**. If repeated samples were taken and the 95% confidence interval computed for each one, the true **difference in population proportions** would fall inside the confidence interval in 95% of the samples\n",

    "<sup>1</sup> The **significance level**, often denoted by α, is the highest probability you are willing to accept of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true. A commonly used significance level is 0.05 (or 5%)"
