    "In addition to the numerical output shown above we can also investigate the association between `pclass` and `survived` visually. The first chart has standard error bars for the proportion of `yes` entries for `survived` in the sample. Consistent with the summary results shown above there are clear differences in the survival rate across passenger classes. The `Dodge` chart shows the proportions of `yes` and `no` in `survived` side-by-side for each passenger class. While 1st class passengers had a higher proportion of `yes` than `no` the opposite seems to hold for the 3rd class passengers."

    "- Compare Proportions in Radiant-for-Python is set up to produce the same results provided by Radiant-for-R. Radiant-for-R uses the `prop.test` function and the confidence intervals are calculated using the Wald's method.\n",
    "- For one-sided tests (i.e., `Less than` or `Greater than`) critical values can be obtained by using the normal distribution in the probability calculator and squaring the corresponding Z-statistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Multiple comparison adjustment\n",
    "\n",
    "The more comparisons we evaluate, the more likely we are to find a “significant” result just by chance even if the null hypothesis is true. If we conduct 100 tests and set our **significance level** at 0.05 (or 5%) we can expect to find 5 p.values smaller than or equal to 0.05 even if there are no associations in the population.\n",

Using a significance level of 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis for each pair of passengers classes evaluated, and conclude that the true population **difference in proportions** is **not equal to 0**.\n",

    "The p.value for the test of differences in the survival proportion for 1st versus 2nd class passengers is **< .001**. This is the probability of observing a sample **difference in proportions** that is as or more extreme than the sample **difference in proportions** from the data if the null hypothesis is true. In this case, it is the probability of observing a sample **difference in proportions** that is less than **-0.194** or greater than **0.194** if the true population **difference in proportions** is **0**.\n",
